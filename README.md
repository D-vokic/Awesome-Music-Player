## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- A modern web-browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Usage

1. Use the play/pause button to play or pause the track.
2. Use the next and previous buttons to change tracks.

## Running the Tests

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for automated testing. Here's how you can run the tests:

1. First, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. If not, you can download and install them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. If you haven't already, install the project dependencies using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Run the tests:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

This will start Jest and run all test files (`*.test.js`) in the project. If the tests are successful, you will see an output indicating the number of passed tests. If some tests fail, Jest will provide an error message explaining the reason for the failure.

## Deployment
